# React.js Challenge

This is my GitHub React.js project. I have completed the first and second challenges (I think) and added some of my own things to the website, but they aren't too noticable. I tried to have a little fun and started messing around with routes and css a bit. In my opinion, I'd say React.js is more fun to use than HTML/CSS/Javascript because it sort of combines the three. The only problems I ran into when making this would have to be CSS stylesheets. I couldn't really figure them out, which made styling the background for the contact page difficult. In react, the css stylesheets are global, which means multiple files aren't technically necessary. This made it a problem for me to style the body element in the contact page, since changing the css would affect the whole website. I decided to use some javascript and the useEffect hook. That seemed to fix the problem, but I don't know if there are other ways to do it.

As for the third challenge, I still haven't learned enough about databases to be able to do it yet. I still have a bit to learn. I also forgot to mention that I tried making the css a bit better and hopefully more efficient this time. Lastly, I don't know how to deploy this website to GitHub-pages, so for now, it'll just have to be downloaded and run manually. Anyways, that's all I had to say about this project. I spent the whole day yesterday working on this and time flew so fast that I didn't even realize it. I just finished it today so I might as well submit it for now.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
